				<h3 id=#intro>Directed Research at the UW</h3>
                    <p>The winter of my Freshman year of college, I had my first taste of user research through a <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/directed" target="_blank">Directed Research Group</a> (aka: DRG). These are put on every quarter and led by faculty in the Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. </p>
                    <p>The group I participated in focused on <b>process blogging as a professional and/or reflective practice</b>. Our research was driven by questions such as:</p>
                    <li>What are process blogs and why create them? What is process blogging and why do it?</li>
                    <li>What’s hard about process blogging, and how can we help individuals be more effective?</li>
                    <li>How might different perspectives on reflection be used to frame supports for process blogging?</li>

                <h3 id=#research>Interviews</h3>
                     <p>The main research method we employed was interview. Our group invited three students to come in and share their experiences with process blogging as part of an introductory design class.</p>

                        <p>Afterwords, Kush and I went asked the professor of the class if we could go through the current rubric to see exactly what the students base their blogs off of. We noticed that the most points (25 total) go towards the professionalism, the layout, and the grammar of the blog.</p>

                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
				<p>
				From these interviews, there were many important points made, but the biggest takeaways that inspired my team's project were centered around feedback as a method of improving process blogging.				
				</p>
                <li>Although process blogging is a personal endevor, students are highly concerned about their grades, so they may have a difficult time writing freely without worrying about grammar.</li>
                <li>Imagined audience plays an important role when students write their process blog.</li>
                <br>
                <p>There is no denying that a TA will be reading the process blog, so for my project, I wanted to reduce grade anxiety and improve the process blogging experience by exploring ways to foster a meaningful relationship between students and their TA's. Therefore, feedback system design became our focus for the rest of the quarter.</p>

				<h3 id=#takeaways>Takeaways</h3>
                <p>At the end of the quarter, we wrote down our reflections on the DRG. This experience had introduced me to user research and working with a team to design solutions for our users. This experience belongs in my portfolio because this project helped me realize my love for design. </p>
				<i class="blockquote">
				
				"Coming into the class on day one, I knew I found my place. I loved the collaborative environment we had in our little classroom
				with our small group. It almost seemed informal. This is a common theme I noticed throughout the research group:
				where should one draw the line between professionalism and informalism? This question pertains to both in processing blogs and
				in design spaces. My research was about creating an environment that helps students and teachers learn from each other, and I can’t help but make this connection, as every day seemed both fun and informative. There was never a moment where I felt like my ideas were shot down, and yet we held each other accountable to do our best work. At the end, I felt like I was able to learn a lot, not only about process blogs and the class design, but about myself, and which environment I thrive best in."
